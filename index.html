  <div class="safeStep1Text"><b>1. Decide where to donate</b><br>Look here for our donation locations or donate directly to somewhere else. Please contact location host before you start your drive so you can schedule a drop-off time with them.</div>
  <div class="safeStep2Text"><b>2. Get Organized</b><br>Figure out where you want to host your drive and get set up. As a general rule, it is best not to host a drive longer than two weeks, otherwise you may end up with more stuffed animals than you bargained for.</div>
  <div class="safeStep3Text"><b>3. Donate</b><br>If you are donating to one of our donation locations, you do not need to clean your donations(our chapter members will do that), but please do not donate any torn up or damaged stuffed animals.</div>
  <div class="safeStep4Text"><b>4. Good Job!</b><br>Thats it! You're all done. Thankyou again and have a great day.</div>

  <div class="bdayStep1Text"><b>1. Decide where to donate</b><br>Look here for our donation locations or donate directly to somewhere else. Please contact location host before you start your drive so you can schedule a drop-off time with them.</div>
  <div class="bdayStep2Text"><b>2. Plan It</b><br>Decide whether you will be accepting gently used items(in which case you can follow the 'SAFE drive' directions above) or making new stuffed animals, which you can order at <a href="https://www.thezoofactory.com/8-inch-party-packages">www.thezoofactory.com</a>.</div>
  <div class="bdayStep3Text"><b>3. Stuff Them</b><br>Stuff the animals carefully, for overstuffing can damage the seams and waste stuffing.</div>
  <div class="bdayStep4Text"><b>4. Donate</b><br>Take the newly made stuffed animals to a SAFE location so that they can be sent on their way to children in need!</div>
  
  <div class="donations">See <a href="https://d4q2.github.io/donatemoney/">here</a> for monetary donations.<br><b>Under no circumstances are you to solicit money in the name of SAFE.</b></div>
